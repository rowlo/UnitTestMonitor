UnitTestMonitor is an application assisting in monitoring unit tests and lcov coverage reports.

The application is designed to be able to analyse Qt testlib unit test output. It identifies testlib projects by name: test projects need to have the same name as the tested project but end with "Test", e.g. if you have a project "libFoo" UnitTestMonitor will scan "libFooTest".
